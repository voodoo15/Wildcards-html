# Wildcards-html

Wildcards HTML version

Created a duplicate in HTML/CSS/JS of the original Wildcards website from www.gowildcards.com by hand ('kinda sorta' made it by hand since I used some plugins for functionality...I originally used Rapidweaver to create the original site).  I did implement Slick for the carousel functionality and Slacktable for the responsive table so it's responsive and readable on a mobile device. 

The purpose of this version of the Wildcards site was to have a site up for a potential team sponser to view and also so the team has somewhere to view the season schedule until I have the rails version up and running to view stats and other stuff.
